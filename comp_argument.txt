Farmington has a lot of mosquitoes. However, it is not the number of mosquitoes
that is the problem, it's the way we deal with them. Farmington mists for
mosquitoes, but they only do it once the mosquitoes become a nuisance, not
when it would help most. Also, this mist gets all over gardens and yards, making
it almost impossible to have an organic garden.
