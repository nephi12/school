1.	The author tells the story of the young Lochinvar through verse. The
first scene in which we are introduced to Lochinvar and given an Idea of why
he is going there, is the exposition. For the rising action we read that he 
comes back and is looking for his lost bride for one last dance. The conflict
is him trying together as his wife and her father not even nicely approving
of his dancing with her. The climax is when they are dancing and Lochinvar 
whispers to her, and the leave. The resolution is when Lochinvar rides away
with her and they don't get caught. The characters have a history, they are 
handsome and strong, and there is a conflict.

2. 	Poe uses language to create mood by using words which give the 
reader a deeper sense into what the poem is saying about both the 
main character, his circumstance, and his mindset.
For instance, Poe tells us that it is a "midnight dreary."
He says in another paragraph that it is December. Both "midnight"
and "December" tell you it is the end of something. Midnight 
being the end of day, December being the end of the year. What 
do you gather from that? He uses these words to convey that 'the end' is
certainly near for the main character, meaning of course the ultimate end: death.
This should convey to you that he is talking about death, specifically the
death of Lenore, his lost love; he is also talking about Death in general.

3.	The theme of the poem "the creation" is that the creator is all powerful
and loving. That he can shape a galaxy in a more 7 steps, and that he makes everything
without error. "his footsteps hollowed out the valleys and bulged up the mountains." 
this shows that he is mighty in strength, and stature. "like a mammy bending over 
her baby" this shows that he is loving in nature.
