1.  Which trials created a situation with a mechanical advantage greater than
 1? Explain why these would be effective uses for levers, compared to those
 trials where the mechanical advantage was less than or equal to 1.

 When the load was close to the fulcrum and the distance between the load and
the scale was large. These would be effective uses for levers because they
would make it easier to lift the load.
