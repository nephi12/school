A:
 The first story is called the lady or the lion. It features a very interesting
Resolution, as the most obvious main conflict never gets resolved. The author
Decided to leave that one up to the reader. However the much deeper conflict
Is not quite as obvious, but it does get resolved. This is the resolution I
Will describe. Throughout the story, the reader faces a very personal
Conflict, the decision of whether or not they agree with the methods used by
The autocrat. While the characters are developed, we see the king's methods
Through their eyes. As we do this, we will likely be wobbling on the
Metaphorical fence, so to speak. Then, we get the news that the reader will
Have to determine whether we end with the lion or the lady. In that instant
Most of us will determine that the king’s methods are in just and while the main
Conflict will not be resolved, hopefully that one will. Anyway, the theme of
The story is that serving justice can be quite a challenge.

 The next is called the lottery, though don't hope for money. In this story
The resolution is quite obvious, almost too obvious as the reader might not
Even be aware of the conflict when they hit the resolution, which is the
Devastating blow of poor Tessie being stoned! The theme? That evens the most
Ordinary people can do horrible and extraordinary things.

B:
 A third person limited narrator is used in "the secret life of Walter Mitty"
So that the author could retain homer without looking at Mitty from
Someone-else's point of view.
 He does it by sharing Mitty’s thoughts and actions, but only his wife’s
Actions, not her thoughts.
