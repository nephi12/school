1. Explain why average velocity in one dimension can be positive or negative.
You are either advancing in the "forward" direction, or you are retreating in
the opposite direction.

2. Can speed ever be negative? Explain.
No. Speed is direction / time. Since we currently do not know how to move a
negative amount in time or distance, we can't have a negative speed.
